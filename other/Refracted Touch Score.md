## Section 1a _[ Resonate ]_

### Techniques

#### Slide Position
- Extremely high, almost banging into the bridge
- Occassionally digress to other parts of the neck, but only briefly.

#### Slide Behaviour
1. Extremely light tapping
2. Fast, erratic oscillations
3. *'Ripple'* movements moving in a linear direction

#### Right Hand
***N.B never open strings***
***These techniques are to be overlayed with the slide behaviour***
1. Do nothing if you are tapping
2. Extreme dynamic picking. Hover around a quiet dynamic and rupture into a loud spasm. This can last a single or multiple invidivual picks.
3. Fast, ***ppp*** picking.

### Electronics

#### Trajectory
The electronics will start with no resonaotrs and will build to 3 separate instances of it.
The density of the electronics will increase depending on how much energy you are put into the system. Watch the slider to gauge how fast you are pushing it.

#### Interactivity
The electronics will be analysing the harmonic content of your playing.
They snapshot this information when the sound of your playing is predominantly upper register. [2000 hz and greater]
Listen to the effect that the energy of your playing has on the electronics and work responsively with the output of the computer.
